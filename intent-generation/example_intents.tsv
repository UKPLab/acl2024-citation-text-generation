Instead of using a traditional curriculum learning setup, spaced repetition bins examples based on estimated difficulty, and shows bins to the model at differing intervals so that harder examples are seen more frequently than easier ones. This method has been shown to be effective for human learning, and results demonstrate effectiveness on NLP tasks as well. Similarly to traditional curriculum learning, SR uses heuristics for difficulty and rigid schedulers to determine when examples should be re-introduced to the learner.	To reveal the similarities and differences between spaced repetition strategies and and traditional curriculum learning.

SEMBIAS identifies the correct analogy of he−she in a word embedding according to four pairs of words: a gender definition word pair (e.g., waiter − waitress), a gender-stereotype word pair (e.g., doctor − nurse) and two other pairs of words that have similar meanings (e.g., dog − cat, cup − lid).	To provide an overview of how SEMBIAS uses word pairs to evaluate gender bias in word embeddings.

(2015) constructed a Chinese corpus CNeSP analogous to the BioScope corpus. They again tackled the negation scope extraction task using CRF with rich syntactic features extracted from constituency and dependency trees.

They have also been applied to realisation ranking in NLG, to select the best of a set of candidate generated sentences. Here we review some of these, with a focus on the work of Cahill et al. (2007), as this is the setup closest to the one we use in this paper. Velldal and Oepen (2006) implemented realisation ranking in the context of an MT system that uses a hand-crafted HPSG grammar to generate sentences from semantic specifications. Their system produced multiple candidate sentences which were ranked under three different models: an n-gram LM; a discriminative maximum entropy model using (HPSG) structural features; and a combination of the two, which produced the best results.	To review some of generated sentences ranking models by giving brief explanations.

In his work, the phrase tables are merged by keeping all the phrase pairs unchanged from the in-domain phrase table, and only adding in the phrase pairs from the general-domain phrase tables that are not contained at the in-domain phrase table, as in (1):	To explain the translation model fill-up approach.

(Verbeke et al., 2012), on the other hand, apply a statistical relational learning approach using a kernel-based learning (kLog) framework to perform classification using the NICTA-PIBOSO corpus. They exploit the relational and background knowledge in abstracts, but take into account only the sequential information at word level. More concretely, their feature set includes a sequence of class labels of the four previous sentences as well as of the two following ones, the lemma of the dependency root of the current sentence and the previous sentence, the position of the sentence, and the section information.
